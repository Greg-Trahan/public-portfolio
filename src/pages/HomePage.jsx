      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <h3>My name is Greg Trahan, welcome to my portfolio!</h3>
      <p>I am an emerging full-stack web developer, having recently finished my training through the University of Minnesota. Through my coursework, I learned the core skills I will need to succeed in a position as a web developer, such as REST API methods and the MERN technology stack. I also am proficient in other technologies including jQuery, Sequelize, Bootstrap, Git, Microsoft Office, and Python. I am excited to put the skills to work as I begin a career developing brililant and engaging websites.</p>

      <p>Proior to training in web development, I spent 5 years working as a Molecular Biologist. During that time I gained valuable experience in detail-oriented work and time management skills with projects like molecular cloning and aseptic cell culture.</p>


      <h4>I've been developing, and managing the development of, enterprise-level interactive Web applications since the early 1990s. I am an unusual and valuable blend of communications expertise, technology understanding and vision, and development skill -- and I have worked in all phases of the interactive process, from strategic planning to project/account management to in-the-trenches development.</h4>

      <h4>I'm well-versed in Agile management practices and can manage clients, projects, and/or development teams. I'm highly-experienced with most modern management tech stacks, such as Jira, Slack, Trello, the Google Suite, etc. I'm also well-versed with using Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager, and Google Optimize, and the principles of A/B and Multivariate testing.</h4>
